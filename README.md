# Diabetes prediction

1. The objective of this project is to predict whether the patient has diabetes or not based on various features like Glucose level, Insulin, Age, BMI.
2. The dataset is downloaded from kaggle and it consist of 2,000 records with 8 independent features.
3. Performed EDA, data clearning and data visualization using various libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn.
4. The dataset is tested with different machine learning algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, SVC and RandomForest.
5. Random Forest Classifier is used after doing hyperparameter tunning as it achieved an accuracy of 99%.
6. Deployed in Heroku cloud using Flask. https://diabetes-predictionapi.herokuapp.com/
